# UX Guidelines

**Read this before modifying client UI or visual components.**

## Design Principles

This is a **mobile-first, one-hand vertical experience** designed for portrait-orientation gameplay.

### Layout Requirements

- **Player hand at bottom** - Horizontal scroll or drawer for 13 cards
- **Last played hand prominent in center** - Tap to view full round history
- **Card sizing** - Cards must shrink to fit large hands (10+ cards in a run)

### Target Platform

- **Web browsers** on mobile devices
- **Portrait orientation** only
- **Touch-optimized** for thumb-friendly interactions
